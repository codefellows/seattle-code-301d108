# Overview of the warm-up challenge

> Break students out into groups of 2-4 for 10 minutes. After regrouping, lead a 5-minute discussion related to their findings, questions answers, and solutions. Encourage them to complete as many as they can, increasing the difficulty level after every correct answer.

This warmup is intended to give students practice working with larger JSON structures with lots of nested objects and arrays.
