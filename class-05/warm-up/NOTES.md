# Overview of the warm-up challenge

> Break students out into groups of 2-4 for 10 minutes. After regrouping, lead a 5-minute discussion related to their findings, questions answers, and solutions.

Common outputs that may need additional prompts to shape results:

- Initial prompt may componentize into functional components rather than class components.
- Animal Component not keeping track of its own state for votes.
- Consider prompting to move the data into a seperate JSON file to mirror how we've handled data up to this point.
