## 1. Create a server!

With the help of a chatbot, create a web server with the following requirements:

- Listens on port 3000 by default
- Has 1 GET route: `/items` that lists the names of items in a list
- Has 1 POST route: `/items` that adds an item to the list
- The list can be stored as an array in memory

## 2. Confirm that the code given will run properly

Copy, paste and run the code in a Repl

## 3. Document the code with proper doc style comments in the code

## 4. Review

If you were doing a code review for your team, and another developer had submitted this code, what would you suggest as changes for efficiency, readability, extensibility and/or scale?

## 5. Consider

Could you do this exercise again to create a basic web server in Python, Java, or .Net?

How would you change your chatbot prompt?
